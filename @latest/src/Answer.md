# Difference between Simple Component and Pure Component :- 

# Simple Component - A simple component in React means the basic React.Component. It re-renders whenever it receives new props or state, regardless of if we have done any change. 

# Pure Component - In contrast, a pure component, which is React.PureComponent. It automatically prevents unnecessary renders when props and state remain unchanged and only re-renders when we have done any change in the prop or state.
